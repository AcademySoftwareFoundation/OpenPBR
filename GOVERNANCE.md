# OpenPBR Project Governance

OpenPBR is a subproject of
[MaterialX](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX) and
inherits its broader governance and contribution policies.  MaterialX is a
project of the [Academy Software Foundation](https://www.aswf.io/) and relies
on the ASWF governance policies, supported by the Linux Foundation.

The OpenPBR subproject maintains its own Technical Steering Committee
(TSC), which has final authority over the subproject.  As defined in the
broader project charter, TSC responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

- Discussions, seeking consensus, and where necessary, voting on technical
  matters relating to OpenPBR that affect multiple projects.
- Maintainance and administration of the OpenPBR GitHub repository.
- Coordinating technical direction of the project.
- Coordinating marketing, events, and communications regarding OpenPBR.

Within the TSC there are two key subgroups: **Voting Members**, who take on
formal responsibiities for maintaining the OpenPBR project and vote when
decisions are required; and **Stakeholders**, who represent specific teams and
companies in the industry and speak on their behalf in OpenPBR discussions.

### Voting Members

These committee members are responsible for contributing actively to the
OpenPBR project, whether it's in the form of developing code, improving the
specification and documentation, reviewing pull requests on GitHub, or
assisting teams with their OpenPBR integrations.  Although we expect most
decisions to be unanimous across the OpenPBR TSC, for decisions where a
formal vote is required, a majority of voting members is required to move
forward with a change.

The current Voting Members of the OpenPBR TSC are:

- Adrien Herubel - Autodesk
- Andr√©a Machizaud - Adobe
- Jonathan Stone - Lucasfilm ADG

### Stakeholders

These committee members represent teams or companies that are closely aligned
with the OpenPBR project, and have a strong interest in how it evolves going
forward.  Stakeholders speak on behalf of their team or company in OpenPBR
discussions, providing the breadth of perspectives that is required to guide
the project.  Most new committee members start in this category, and it
doesn't require a commitment on their part to contribute to or maintain the
OpenPBR project, though they are encouraged to do so.

The current Stakeholders of the OpenPBR TSC are:

- Frederic Servant - Autodesk
- Guido Quaroni - Adobe

### TSC Nomination and Succession

Any proposal for additional members of the TSC may be submitted by reaching
out to a current TSC member on Slack or raising the issue at a TSC meeting.
New TSC members are accepted or rejected by majority vote of the TSC.

If a TSC member is for an extended period not regularly participating or
performing the responsibilities expected of TSC members, the TSC may by
majority vote request an alternate TSC member be submitted by that
organization, or remove the inactive member from the TSC.

A member of the TSC may nominate a successor in the event that such member
decides to leave the TSC, and the TSC shall confirm or reject such nomination
by a vote.  In the event that the departing member's nomination for successor
is rejected by vote of the TSC, the departing member shall be entitled to
continue nominating successors until one such successor is confirmed by vote
of the TSC.  If the departing member fails or is unable to nominate a
successor, the TSC may nominate one on the departing member's behalf.

Voting TSC membership is presumed to be retained by the individual even if
they change employers.  The TSC may take action to ensure that organizational
stakeholder representation not become severely disproportionate, for example by
urging an organization that loses its sole TSC representative to nominate a
new member, or to limit the total number of members from any one organization
if too many members all move to the same organization.

### TSC Meetings

OpenPBR discussions and votes are included in the agenda for meetings of the
MaterialX TSC, and members of the OpenPBR TSC should attend these meetings
when relevant topics are planned.  Scheduling and connection details may be
found in the public
[ASWF Meeting Calendar](https://www.aswf.io/meeting-calendar/).
